The solution involves ensuring the `.special-class p` rule has higher specificity than the other rules:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* Less specific */
}

.special-class p {
  color: purple; /* More specific */
}

/* Optionally, you can use the `!important` flag for overriding other rules, but this should be used sparingly */
.special-class p {
  color: purple !important; /* Explicitly override */
}
```

By adjusting the selectors or using the `!important` flag (though generally not recommended), the expected color can be achieved. The corrected CSS code is now correctly applying the `purple` color because of higher specificity.
