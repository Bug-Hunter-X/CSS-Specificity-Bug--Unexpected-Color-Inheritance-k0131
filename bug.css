The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule should override the div and p rules */
}

.special-class p {
  color: purple; /* This rule should have higher specificity */
}

<div>
  <p class="special-class">This text should be purple.</p>
</div>
```

The expected outcome is that the text within the paragraph with the class "special-class" should be purple because of the specificity of the `.special-class p` rule. However, the text might appear green or even red if there is a subtle problem with specificity calculation, particularly when dealing with complex selectors or inheritance.
